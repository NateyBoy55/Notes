# Types of Flaws 

### Flawed arguments are everywhere...

- knowing about the different flaws in arguments can help you identify weak points in these questions 
- FLAWS can be described in different ways...
  - *Lachelle is late for dinner, so she must be stuck in traffic.*
  - Can be seen as the arguer **assuming without** warrant that traffic is the only reason Lachelle would be late for dinner,
  - AND that the arguer **overlooks the possibility** that traffic not the only reason Lachelle would be late for dinner.
  - THERE are different ways that flaws can be described in the choices

## Sampling 
- Flaws can occur when an argument extends limited info (ie, a "sample") and tries to apply more widely than acceptable
  - Examples include: 
  - Polls, surveys, studies; data or statistics from limited source (one meteorologist is not enough for it to come out of sample range)
  - shift from evidence to conclusion during which the arguer tells (not shows) that one is acceptably representative of the other

- Sample must be **Representative**, sample must address:
  - relevant things or people, of an appropriate number, and must be unbiased 
- Example: 
  - The more modern archaeologists learn about Mayan Civilization, the better they understand the achievenments. The Mayan Religious scribes exhibit high degree of mathematical competence, as well as scientific observations and prediction from Mayan Astronomers show that the Mayan people in general seem to be intellects.
  - WHAT? The people in **"General**", are smart, because of math and science of a few "sampled groups" of the Mayans? Religious scribes should have a greater degree of intellect than the public, so that group is likely biased and not representative of the whole. 

  ## Ad Hominem
  - An arguer criticizes someone's actionsm their character, and their motives as a reason to not heed their argument
  - important to remember that identity or motives, or even a hypocritical person's argument can still be valid if it is backed up with evidence and is obviously well supported and without flaws
  - Example:
    Mullen proposed to raise taxes on rich. YET Mullen's tax record shows that he heavily invests in business and had large profits. Mullen's proposal does not deserve our consideration. Same as "Mullen propposed a ban of smoking in public spaces, he is a heavy smoker.

  ## Faulty Analogy 
  - arguer comparing two things or two situations, but the two things aren't sufficiently alike. 
    - Example: 
    - a kid's entire class lost two day's of recess because someone was throwing raisins. The kid mentioned was not throwing raisins. To justify this, the teacher uses the analysis of "being stuck in a traffic jam". People in the accident didn't cause it but nevertheless have to suffer by sitting in the middle of it. 
    - principle in FLAWED in his logic as he is acting as if the mass punishment of taking away everyone's recess is suffciently comparable to the mass punishment of sitting through a traffic jam. There is no rescinding the traffic jam, but the principle **CAN** change the parameters of the punishment. 

  ## Quantity versus percent 
- arguer treats quantities and percents as interchangeable; percents do not tell you about actual numbers, so using percentages can hide the actual material facts of the situation ()

  ## Lack of evidence as proof 
- The arguer takes a lack of evidence for a conclusion; taking an absence of evidence for "evidence of absence"
