# Evidence

Types of Evidence

### it can be useful to separate and identify different types of evidence used in an argument

- Helps avoid getting "lost" in the words; actively realizing evidence helps focus

- classic evidence structures: helps you identify answers quickly for assumptions or flaws or any other way evidence can be presented 

### Examples as evidence 

- Paola is the best athlete in the state.
   - **EXAMPLES AS EVIDENCE OF THAT CLAIM**: Paola has won medals in 8 different olympic sports. 
   - Paola beat last year's decathalon state champion
   - **DRAWING ON WHAT OTHERS SAY (APPEAL):** a highly acclaimed sports magazine named her as such. 
   - the population voted paola as the Best Athlete in the state in a landslide. 
*tip for flaws and assumptions*: ensure that the objective appeal is relevant and useful; if a scientific claim is made, but only appeals to one scientific expert, there is alot of room to attach that argument. 
    - **USING THE PAST**: arguers use the past to justify a conclusion, often with the assumption that things have not changed. 
    - Paola won the state championship last year,
