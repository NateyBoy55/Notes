# Conclusions
Types of Conclusions 
- conclusions can carry different implications, and can inform how you answer the question - when an arguer's conclusion is a recommendation, they will then provide one good reason to do that thing, there is an assumption that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks
- When an arguer's conclusion is a prediction, the arguer may be assuming that the current evidence will remain unchanged in the future
Comparisons: comparative conclusion that compares two elements (performance, results, data, etc), or compares one element to itself; (it is clear that this year's candidate is stronger than last year's candidate0
Causation: When one thing (event, action, phenomena) directly affects another, it becomes causal relationship. (Last night I took cough medicine and today I feel much better)

Degrees of conclusion
- if you are short on time; it is CRUCIAL to be aware of the conclusion type and its degree to eliminate choices quickly in "Matching Arguments" and "Matching Flaws" questions because the conclusions in the passages are usually of the same type and similar degree as the conclusion in answer
DEFINITE CONCLUSION: 
also referred to as categorical conclusions, signaled by keywords such as all, every, none, never, will
- if doing a match the flaw question, definite conclusions can indicate that the arguer is overlooking other possibilities in drawing that conclusion; AND in a match the structure or match the flaws question, THE DEGREE of the conclusion will oftne match the conclusion of the argument in the passage
- USEFUL when trying to quickly determine solution to a specific type of question
INDEFINITE CONCLUSION:
qualified conclusions; often signaled by keywords:
- Likelihood: likely, unlikely, possible, could, might
- Quantity: Some, most, more
- Frequency: rarely, seldom, often, sometimes, usually
- proximity: almost, nearly
- if the argument indicates that a conclusion isnt necessarily true 100% or 0% of the time, it can be classified as indefinite

## Identifying the Conclusion 
- The conclusion in the one statement that is supported by the other students, and that itself doesn't support any other statements;
  - DO NOT get it confused with the **Sub-Conclusion**, also known as the subsidiary or intermediate conclusion; it is a claim that isn't the main conclusion, it is a conclusion that supports a different conclusion (1+1 = 2, this is true because of these facts, so that means that it supports the idea that this is also true) 

## Conclusion Checklist
  - **Find the point**: Determine which statement seems like the main prediction, the value judgement, interpretation, or the theory; WHAT IS THE MAIN THING that the arguer is trying to convince us of?
  - **Look for support indicator words**: Some words indicate the statement they introduce is part of support statement; are not conclusions; support indicators like becausem since, and for can introduce the EXPLANATION of why an arguer believes a claim
  - **Clarify Pronouns**: If the main conclusion is ambiguous (Maybe it has supportive statements, and other claims that lead into the final conclusion of "*this* is a mistake". rearrange the the passage, what is "this" and what does it mean that it's a "mistake?")
