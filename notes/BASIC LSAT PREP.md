# BASIC LSAT PREP

BASIC LSAT NOTES

READ; completely read the question before proceeding; know what it is asking instead of wasting time re-reading the passage
- break the passage down; sometimes it is more effective to split it into the conclusion and the support that goes along with it, maybe just focus on the conclusion; many different logical and reasoning questions; maybe all you need to do is piece the claims together 
- some questions you should make a prediction of what the answer will be, before looking at the choices; evaluate the choices; does this choice match with my prediction? does this choice HAVE to be true based on the statements above
- know what you are looking for into your own words; you gain control of the task
- prepare for a variety of challenges; maybe skip and return to it if necessary 
- UNDERLINE OR BRACKET an arguments conclusion when you find, maybe underline some others parts of the support that can be useful

CONCLUSION Vs. EVIDENCE 
- Conclusion: arguer will belive the conclusion, but the reason for her believing it is the support or the evidence

Complex Arguments
- might include intermediate conclusions; subsidiary conclusions; a conclusion that acts as both a conclusion and evidence
- "Sarah will probably receive a job offer, because she has ten years of experience. that means  that she'll soon pay me back for the money that I lent her"

Conclusion + Evidence + Background information 
- one primary goal of the LSAT is to rephrase the argument in its "conclusion, because support" form in order to keep it simple. It is rare that background info holds info critical to your ability to complete a task; it is important to read between the lines and know the information that is key
- look for keywords that are found in the beginning of a conclusion sentence or a conclusion clause; Thus, therefore, hence, conclude, clearly, etc, which signal that some form of evidence has made something "clear", which means that usually they will include key words; NOT ALWAYS INCLUDING THESE KEYWORDS
